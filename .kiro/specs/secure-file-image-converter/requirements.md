# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a stateless, client-side secure file transfer system that converts password-encrypted files into images for manual transmission. The system operates entirely in the browser without any server-side storage or user accounts, providing a secure way to transmit sensitive files through image sharing platforms or messaging services.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user wanting to securely share a file, I want to upload a file and encrypt it with a password so that it can be converted into an image for safe transmission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user drags and drops a file or uses a file picker THEN the system SHALL accept the file for processing
2. WHEN a user enters a password THEN the system SHALL require a non-empty password before proceeding
3. WHEN a file exceeds 1GB in size THEN the system SHALL display an error message and reject the file
4. WHEN the encryption process begins THEN the system SHALL display a visual progress indicator
5. WHEN encryption is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a downloadable PNG image containing the encrypted data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to use strong encryption so that my files remain secure during transmission.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encrypting a file THEN the system SHALL use AES-GCM 256-bit encryption
2. WHEN generating encryption keys THEN the system SHALL derive keys using PBKDF2 with a random 16-byte salt
3. WHEN encrypting data THEN the system SHALL use a random 12-byte initialization vector (IV)
4. WHEN creating the encrypted payload THEN the system SHALL include a magic header, salt, IV, and encrypted data in that order
5. WHEN validating encrypted data THEN the system SHALL use AES-GCM's built-in integrity checking

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want encrypted files to be converted into standard image formats so that they can be shared through any image-sharing platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting encrypted data to an image THEN the system SHALL encode the Base64 string as RGB pixel data
2. WHEN mapping Base64 to pixels THEN the system SHALL convert every 3 Base64 characters into 1 RGB pixel
3. WHEN creating the image THEN the system SHALL automatically size it as a square or use fixed width dimensions
4. WHEN exporting the image THEN the system SHALL generate a PNG file for download
5. WHEN the image is created THEN the system SHALL ensure it doesn't exceed browser memory limits

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a recipient, I want to upload an encrypted image and decrypt it with a password so that I can recover the original file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an image file THEN the system SHALL accept PNG files for decryption
2. WHEN a user enters a decryption password THEN the system SHALL attempt to decrypt the image data
3. WHEN processing the image THEN the system SHALL extract pixel data and convert it back to Base64
4. WHEN parsing the encrypted format THEN the system SHALL verify the magic header and extract salt, IV, and encrypted data
5. WHEN decryption is successful THEN the system SHALL provide a download link for the restored file

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error handling so that I understand what went wrong if decryption fails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an invalid password is entered THEN the system SHALL display "Invalid password" error message
2. WHEN a corrupted or invalid image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL display "This image does not contain a valid encrypted file"
3. WHEN the magic header is missing or incorrect THEN the system SHALL display "Unrecognized format"
4. WHEN any decryption error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages without exposing technical details
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL not crash or expose sensitive information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want all operations to happen client-side so that my files and passwords never leave my browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL perform all encryption and decryption operations in the browser
2. WHEN handling passwords THEN the system SHALL never transmit passwords to any server
3. WHEN storing temporary data THEN the system SHALL not persist any file contents, passwords, or keys beyond the current session
4. WHEN generating cryptographic materials THEN the system SHALL use browser-native crypto APIs
5. WHEN the user closes the browser THEN the system SHALL not retain any sensitive information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the interface to be intuitive and provide clear feedback so that I can easily encrypt and decrypt files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the encryption interface THEN the system SHALL provide drag-and-drop file upload with visual feedback
2. WHEN processing files THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators for long-running operations
3. WHEN operations complete THEN the system SHALL provide clear success messages and download prompts
4. WHEN switching between encrypt and decrypt modes THEN the system SHALL provide distinct, clearly labeled interfaces
5. WHEN files are ready for download THEN the system SHALL use descriptive filenames (e.g., "encrypted_file.png", "restored_file.bin")
